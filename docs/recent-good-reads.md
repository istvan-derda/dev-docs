A place where I share interesting coding-related stuff I find on the internet.

## (Maybe) Coming Soon to a Browser Near You: Temporal API 
Today I stumbled over a good read on handling date and time in code by one of the authors of the [Temporal API proposal](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/) on [Planet GNOME](https://planet.gnome.org). It once again shows how much more complex date and time handling are than you usually assume. That lead me to check out the Temporal API proposal, which is now something I'm really excited for.

In his blogpost Philip Chimento gives his thoughts on a tweet that caused quite some controversy:
> A couple of tough questions for all of you:
> 1. Is the date `2022-06-01` equal to the time `2022-06-01 12:00:00`?
> 2. Is the date `2022-06-01` between the time `2022-06-01 12:00:00` and the time `2022-12-31 12:00:00`?
> 3. Is the time `2022-06-01 12:00:00` after the date `2022-06-01`?

Enjoy!
